# The Platinum Rule

The Platinum Rule is a full stack web application that enables users to post and search for neighbors in need of help and volunteer availability.

The idea behind The Platinum Rule was born during the early days of the Covid-19 global pandemic. 

Due to the communicability of Covid-19, daily activities may present a challenge for neighbors at higher risk. Often, people that need help rarely ask for it. While on the other hand, people often offer to help, but are rarely taken up on it. 

The Platinum Rule allows neighbors who need help with daily tasks to find someone nearby who can help while encouraging volunteer-minded neighbors to offer their time and services.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to facilitate a friendly environment to support and encourage neighbors helping neighbors.

## Volunteers

As a volunteer, users may post their availability to help with specific tasks such as running an essential errand or walking a neighborâ€™s dog. Volunteers may also view posts from neighbors who are seeking help with tasks and offer their assistance. 

## Recipients

As a recipient, users may post their help requests for specific tasks such as phone check-ins or picking up groceries. Recipients may also view posts from neighbors available to help and claim help from those volunteers.
